# Overview
This project is my implementation/experimentation of the [hypermodern python project](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) article series by Claudio Jolowicz.

## Helpful Tips
* Running `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` will always generate a virtual environment under `/.venv` in the project folder.
